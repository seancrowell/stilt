Scripts for using STILT output 

## Working with STILT footprints and particle trajectory output from the uataq project
[1] Finding boundary points from the trajectory files for a given domain size
[2] Sampling WRF-GHG output at the boundary points to get CO2, CH4, etc
[3] Performing an inversion (derived from the CT-Lagrange code base)
